This is "Baron Linux" a (for now) crude fork of
[morpheus](http://git.2f30.org/morpheus) that hopes to revive the project and
implement new features, while maintaining morpheus' original goals such as using
mk for package building, using musl as the system's libc, and opting for
libressl in place of openssl

As of 2015-12-21, this distro should hardly work at all. 
Next steps are still being discussed.
