This is "Baron Linux" a (for now) crude fork of
[morpheus](http://git.2f30.org/morpheus) that hopes to revive the project and
implement new features, while maintaining morpheus' original goals:

    - use mk

    - build against musl

    - replace openssl with libressl


As of 2015-12-21, this distro should hardly work at all. 
Next steps are still being discussed.
