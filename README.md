# Stultus Linux

Meta-repo for Stultus Linux, a Morpheus fork hoping to keep Morpheus' original goals while implementing new features.

## Software used

Package manager: [mitti](https://github.com/26c8/mitti), coupled with Plan 9 mk
Init:            [sinit](http://git.2f30.org/sinit/log.html) + (tenative) [urc](https://arcetera.moe/git/urc)

The rest really isn't set in stone.

It barely builds, please don't use this.

## Installation

Yes.

This will be documented better soon. For now, look at Morpheus's building guide.
