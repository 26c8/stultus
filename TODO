* update v.mk in all ports to current versions
* discuss package management implementation
* write solid documentation for:
    - installation
    - port management
    - system operation such as
        1. init
        2. mk
        3. userland (hbase, sbase, etc.)
* figure out build environment (what goes where, what stays on host and what stays on stultus)
